                        Double Whammy is a formal method for practical, creative resolution of problems and creation of solutions, with the intent
                        of an improved future result. In this regard it is a form of solution-based, or solution-focused
                        thinking – starting with a goal (a better future situation) instead of solving a specific problem.
                        By considering both present and future conditions and parameters of the problem, alternative solutions
                        may be explored simultaneously. Nigel Cross asserted that this type of thinking most often happens
                        in the built, or artificial, environment (as in artifacts).<br><br> This
                        approach differs from the analytical scientific method, which begins by thoroughly defining all parameters
                        of a problem to create a solution. Design thinking identifies and investigates with known and ambiguous
                        aspects of the current situation to discover hidden parameters and open alternative paths that may
                        lead to the goal. Because design thinking is iterative, intermediate "solutions" are also potential
                        starting points of alternative paths, including redefining of the initial problem.

                       Wham! had been a dominant force in the UK Singles Chart in 1984 and news that they were planning a Christmas single meant that a battle for the coveted Christmas number one spot in the UK seemed set to be between Wham! and the year's other big act, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, who had achieved a third number one in early December with "The Power of Love". The Band Aid project helmed by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure, however, produced the number one single "Do They Know It's Christmas?". Wham!'s offering peaked at number two for much of the period, although George's involvement in Band Aid meant that Wham! still had an input. Wham! subsequently topped the monies raised by Band Aid by donating all of their "Last Christmas/Everything She Wants" royalties to the Ethiopian famine appeal.

        <p>Last Christmas, I gave you my heart<br>But the very next day, you gave it away<br>This year, to save me from tears<br>I'll

        <p>Last Christmas, I gave you my heart<br>But the very next day, you gave it away<br>This year, to save me from tears<br>I'll
            give it to someone special (special)<br></p>
        <p>Once bitten and twice shy<br>I keep my distance but you still catch my eye<br>Tell me baby do you recognize me?<br>Well
            it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me<br></p>
        <p>I wrapped it up and sent it<br>With a note saying "I Love You" I meant it<br>Now I know what a fool I've been<br>But
            if you kissed me now I know you'd fool me again<br></p>
        <p>Last Christmas, I gave you my heart<br>But the very next day, you gave it away<br>This year, to save me from tears<br>I'll
            give it to someone special (special)<br></p>
        <p>Last Christmas, I gave you my heart<br>But the very next day, you gave it away<br>This year, to save me from tears<br>I'll
            give it to someone special (special)<br></p>
        <p>A face on a lover with a fire in his heart<br>A man undercover but you tore him apart<br>Maybe next year,<br>I'll
            give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special<br>Special, someone, someone<br>I'll give it to someone,
            I'll give it to someone special<br></p>
        <p>Who'll give me something in return<br>I'll give it to someone, hold my heart and watch it burn<br></p>
        <p>I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special<br>I thought you were here to stay<br>How can love be for
            a day?<br>I thought you were someone special, gave you my heart<br></p>
        <p>I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone<br>Last Christmas I gave you my heart<br>You gave it away<br>I'll
            give it to someone, I'll give it to someone<br></p>
